# Orbit Storage S3: operations and security

This guide organizes runtime behavior documented by the package. It does not certify production readiness. Verify provider/client versions, permissions, transport security, limits, and failure behavior in the target environment before release.

## Configuration surface

Environment names found in the package README:

The package README does not name `ORBIT_*` variables. Use its typed constructors and application configuration, and confirm exact runtime inputs in the implementation before deployment.

Use the package README's constructor and deployment examples. Store credentials in a secret manager and avoid logging credentials, raw provider errors, request data, or opaque cursors.

## Lifecycle, failure behavior, and limits

`orbit-storage-s3` implements the `orbit-storage` `ObjectStore` capability using aiobotocore. Install it
only when an application uses S3 or an S3-compatible service:

```bash
python -m pip install orbit-core orbit-storage orbit-storage-s3
```

Configure credentials through aiobotocore's standard AWS credential chain (environment, shared
configuration, workload identity/role credentials, or another supported provider). Orbit does not
copy credentials into its own configuration model. HTTPS is required for custom endpoints unless
`allow_insecure_http=True` is explicitly selected for local development. Configure `endpoint_url`
for a compatible object service; endpoint-specific behavior remains outside Core.

```python
from orbit import Application, ApplicationConfig
from orbit_storage_s3 import S3Config, S3ObjectStore, S3ObjectStorePlugin

application = Application(ApplicationConfig(name="reports"))
store = S3ObjectStore(S3Config(bucket="orbit-reports", region_name="us-east-1"))
application.plugins.register(S3ObjectStorePlugin(store))
await application.startup()

await store.put("daily/report.json", b'{"ready": true}', content_type="application/json")
download = await store.get("daily/report.json")
if download is not None:
    async with download:
        async for chunk in download.body:
            consume(chunk)
```

The adapter maps keys and normalized metadata directly to the selected bucket, implements
`ListObjectsV2` pagination, and streams downloads from aiobotocore's response body. Streamed uploads
use sequential S3 multipart requests with bounded adapter buffering (`part_size_bytes`, 8 MiB by
default, plus at most one source chunk) and abort incomplete multipart work after failure or
cancellation. The maximum streamed object size is
bounded by `part_size_bytes * max_parts`; increase the part size deliberately when larger objects
are required, considering the corresponding per-upload memory use. This does not claim S3's full
maximum object size for the default configuration.

`delete` checks object existence before issuing `DeleteObject` to implement the capability's
boolean result; concurrent deletion can race that check. S3 versioning, retention, encryption,
conditional writes, bucket policy, and IAM remain operator/provider concerns. Credentials and raw
SDK exception text are not included in normalized storage errors. The Core plugin registers under
`OBJECT_STORE_DEPENDENCY_KEY` and closes the client at application shutdown. No live AWS or
S3-compatible endpoint test is claimed; tests use fake client objects.

The adapter follows the official [aiobotocore client and StreamingBody patterns](https://github.com/aio-libs/aiobotocore)
and AWS [ListObjectsV2 continuation-token contract](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_ListObjectsV2.html).

## Production validation

Validate startup/shutdown cleanup, timeout and cancellation behavior, concurrency and payload bounds where applicable, secret rotation and least-privilege access, data durability, backup/restore, and failover against the selected provider. Do not infer distributed or durable guarantees from an in-process API or fake-client tests.
